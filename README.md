 News, May 2015

 After a lot of frustration with the old setup (too complex, too error phrone, difficult to compile on linux, headaches with import of graphics, headaches with different shading approaches on different architectures, too many dependencies, complex build chain ...) I finally decided, to build a new version on a different approach.

 So version 0.6 will be different, based on a different C++ library (Urho3D), new build system (CMake), only one base API based on ECS approach. I hope to be able to have a first version ready for the master branch in the next weeks.

 Until then, it is not very useful, to work on older versions, unfortunately, they will not further developed.
