{-$Overview

The commuication model of this library is as follows. There are clients and servers. Clients can connect to servers but not the other way around. So each server can have multiple clients. Both are nodes. Nodes can send and receive messages. 

Upon connection the port is defined on which servers and clients communicate with each other.

In addition to the port, channels exists, to enable parallel streams of messages on different channels.

A client has a name, to identify him. This name is communicated in the first packet from the client to the server. The server needs the client name, to send a package to the specific client. The client does not need a name for the server, since there exists only one connection from the client to one server.
